# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer is a time-management app that provides users with a timer to break down work into intervals of focus and break sessions. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Francesco Cirillo used in the late 1980s. The purpose of the Pomodoro timer is used to manage break time and enhance focus.
